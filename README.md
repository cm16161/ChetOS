## About  ##

This project is to be used in conjunction with the Linux From Scratch (LFS) book 
so that a user will be able to create their own version of Linux with my personal
customisations.

These scripts are designed to be used in conjunction with LFS 9.0
You can find the book: [here](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-9.0.pdf)
